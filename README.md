**Heatmap with intensity based on humidity overlaid with pins for the closest hotel to the plotted city. The cities with pins have the best weather conditions. All cities with pins will have a temperature between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, a wind speed of less than 10 mph, and no clouds.:**<br/>
